    Our main field of activity is architecture design and the projects we have undertaken cover areas of specialty: new construc¬tions, interior design, exterior design / public spaces, restoration / reconversion, object design. Depending on the specific theme of the project and the client’s wish we collaborate with engineering companies or specialists and coordinate all the specialised design engineers involved (structure, installations etc.) to provide complete general design services.<br/>
